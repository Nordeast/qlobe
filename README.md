# qlobe

qlobe is a multi-player game that pits your skills against a friend or foe. While playing on a single device, qlobe puts you in a head to head match up against your playing partner. These challenges are meant to test your speed, knowledge and memorizations skills against one another so you may truly answer the question of who is most skillful. To play the game we suggest sitting across a coffee table or other small surface so both players can see the screen easily. Place the device flat on the surface directly between the 2 players so that each player will have access to half of the screen. Then just hit [Letâ€™s Begin] and let the battle commence.
